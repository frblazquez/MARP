-> TREES:
    + Problem 10: Is a tree balanced?
      The recursive method implemented follows directly the recursive definition
      of balanced tree.
    + Problem 11: Is an AVL tree?
      Recursive method derived from the recursive definition of the AVL condition.
    + Problem 12: Keys in a range given.
      This problem is much more didactic if it's done modifying a BST data struc-
      ture. It's easily done with a variation of search algorithm.
    + Problem 13: Kth element in a BST.
      This problem is designed for adding a new attribute in each node of a BST
      data structure to keep the number of descending nodes. Then a variation of
      the BST search allows us to find the solution.
      
-> HEAPS:
    + Problem 20: Minimise adding cost.
      This problem combines heaps and a greedy algorithm to find the solution.
      We just add always the minimal numbers.
    + Problem 21: Simulation of data sending.
      We use in this problem a heap to execute the simulation with a low complexity.
    + Problem 22: Simulation of a hospital consultation.
      We execute the simulation the number of steps required keeping the concor-
      dance adding or removing elements from the heap.
    + Problem 23: Are some tasks overlaped?
      We again use a greedy algorithm and a heap to have data ordenation with low
      algorithm complexity.
    + Problem 24: Keep the median of a set of numbers during insertions.
      For this problem we use two heaps, a max-heap and min-heap to maintain an
      invariant of equal size for having the median at the top of min-heap.
